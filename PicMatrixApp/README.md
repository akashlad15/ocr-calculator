# PicMatrixApp
The ocr based math equation solving app.
This app allows you to capture a photo and then crop it according to your needs. Then this picture is scanned by google vision api and the result is passed to Wolfram alpha api which produces the math results.
This is originally based upon the project by Rajesh arunachalam.
